Description
-----------
We will be building a web page with contents that will go into GESSA's website.
This is the link to the existing website - [GESSA](http://asu.orgsync.com/org/gessa).

Requirements
------------
- We need to build a responsive website for GESSA
- We need to provide features to easily add new content. This is because we frequently update our website with news
and events.
  - By easily adding a new content, we mean that it should be as simple as a small commit to this repository.
  - For now, the idea is to use this repository to mimic the DNS provider for GESSA website. Any changes made to this repository will be reflected in GESSA website.
  - To learn more about using GitHub repository for web pages, this might be a great starting point - [Using GitHub pages to host your website](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/using-github-pages-to-host-your-website)
- We will be using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) majorly to design the website. We will also be using some other CSS toolkits such as [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) to build the website.
- A detailed requirement with details about each and every content of the website will be updated here soon.

Rules for contributors
----------------------
- Everything goes through Pull request, that gets sent to moderators/owner of repository. Please be descriptive of your change.
- Refrain from emailing and use Github discussions.
- Document everything, remember it is an open source project. Your code might be returned back if there is no proper documentation or if it is difficult to understand for others.
- Be polite and helpful. Remember you can learn from others truly only when you are respectful to them.
- If there are any complaints, you can email to gessaorg@gmail.com where GESSA core team will democratically solve your issue.
